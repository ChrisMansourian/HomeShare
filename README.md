Hello, welcome to the HomeShare App

This app was created for the purpose of college students at USC to find roommates to stay with. 

We implemented the database in this project using a Microsoft Azure SQL Server as well as a Microsoft Azure Deployed Web API to communicate between the database and our HomeShare app using secure protocols. 

Due to limitations in funds we were only able to use Microsoft's student-free plan which severely limits connection speeds. All implementations in the app have been tested and work; however, they may appear to run slowly due to this limited connection.
