Hello, welcome to the HomeShare App

This app was created to foster a safe environment where college students at schools like USC and other schools to find roommates to stay with.

We implemented the database in this project using a Microsoft Azure SQL Server as well as a Microsoft Azure Deployed Web API to communicate between the database and our HomeShare app using secure protocols.

Due to limitations in funds, we were only able to use Microsoft's student-free plan which severely limits connection speeds. All implementations in the app have been tested and work; however, they may appear to run slowly due to this limited connection.
